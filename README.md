# Odin Recipes

This is my first project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), focused on building a basic recipe website using only HTML.

## What I’m Learning
- Structuring content with HTML
- Working with elements like headings, lists, links, and images
- Using Git for version control and GitHub for remote hosting

## Goal
To create a simple, clean recipe page that shows my understanding of semantic HTML and good project structure.

Stay tuned — more features and pages coming soon!
